This folder contains the code to utilize PANNA networks as potentials in LAMMPS, and a minimal example.

To enable PANNA potentials in LAMMPS, just copy the files pair_panna_long* ewald_panna* to your LAMMPS src directory


MODIFICATION NEEDED;

**  Add the following lines to kspace.h code in LAMMPS src

   virtual void compute_A_dot_v(double *, double *, double *){};

and compile as usual.

###################################################

The minimal example provided contains a sample LAMMPS input file with the definition of a PANNA potential, i.e.:

The panna with long range electrostatic

pair_style   panna/long no_pbc
pair_coeff * * network_path parameter_panna.in total_charge
kspace_style ewald/panna 1e-6 parameter_panna.in 

network_path: path to the netwerk paramters
parameter_panna.in: file containing the panna gvector  and Long range parameters
total_charge: system global charge 
no_pbc: used to decide if system is should be treated as molecule or periodic solid

kspace_style: set to compute the Hartree energy in kspace and 
(in this case) the summation is truncated when the gaussian term doesn't change more than 1e-6.

The parameters of pair_coeff are the name of the folder containing the potential and the name of the parameters file.

The potential files can be generated automatically from a trained network by using the code extract_weights.py with the flag

output_type = LAMMPS

See the code description in the Tutorial for more information (in this case the gvector input file is a mandatory field).
